I came up with an idea that utilizes a technique we used in CS2 last year, the idea is that to find the shortest path to something we can use a depth or breadth first search. We also learnt this in terms of binary trees and the mazeSolver problem set. So, my thought process in this is that we can use a queue to keep track of all the possible ladders within 6 spaces of our current position. Over time we can one by one check these possibilities (popping them then adding new ones as we find them to the queue) until we reach the solution. If we use breadth-first search I believe that we should get the shortest move solution as the first returned one. |

It's basic logic and doesn't actually find a solution yet but its a start. |

How do I keep track of which paths I've already taken. I also tried to fix an error in my code that makes it almost always return -1 instead of 1 (couldn't figure out why this is an issue). |
| Sept 5 |  10:30pm - 11pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         This iteration, I deleted my new class and kept all my code contained within the MokshaPatam class for efficiency reasons. I also begin to code an array that would store all the info in the board, the current square and where you go as a result. I created a for loop to read in the data from the snakes and ladders to create this list but the code didn't work. |
| Sept 5 | 11:30pm - 12:00pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I got the list of spaces to work and also modified my while loop. it doesn't work on some test cases which I am trying to troubleshoot right now. Additionally, I am yet to code a way to keep count of the number of rolls but am looking for ways to work on that. Mainly in this last 30 min block I just focused on integrating the array of spaces. |
| Sept 8 |  5:15pm - 6:45pm  | I worked implementing the constant time method we had talked about for arranging the spaces of the board in during class. I had previously thought of it but I ran into many errors while trying to implement it, I met with Mr. Blick and we talked about why my original attempt at it was actually slightly less efficient than the constant time result and also why my code hadn't intially worked. For this iteration I still hadn't implemented a counting technique to return the amount, simply I returned 1 if I made it to the end and -1 if I found no solution. My logic for the spaces array is that it is initialized as an int array of all 0's, then I looped through both the snakes array and the ladders array and added the final location of space (where you went down too on a snake or up to on a ladder) into the corresponding starting location on the spaces array. |
| Sept 9 |  6:15pm - 6:50pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Since I was done including the spaces array I now switched over to working on the moves counting method. I implemented an array (similar to the spaces array) that counted how many times it had taken to reach the most recent location. I essentially implemented this by returning where you currently where + 1 (because one last dice move) if you were within 6 moves of the final space. I would update the board values each time you added a new location to visit to the queue it would add 1 to its moves value + the moves to get to the current location. |
| Sept 9 |  7:00pm - 7:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            As I tested the ideas for the moves I had ran into an issue in which 6th test on the testLarger test wouldn't work. My code would consistently overestimate the answer by 1 (however, all the other tests would work). My first approach to this issue is that maybe my code had missed a faster solution because of the visited boolean array (what if, to find a faster solution you actually had to go down a ladder then up again, in some specific competition). However, upon rewriting my code to not use a visited array I still kept running into the issue. |

Upon fixing this issue my code worked on all of the tests. |
