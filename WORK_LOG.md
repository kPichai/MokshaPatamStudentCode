| Sept 3 | 8:00pm - 8:30pm | Although for this time section I didn't get any coding complete, I did work on my thought process of this problem a lot. I came up with an idea that utilizes a technique we used in CS2 last year, the idea is that to find the shortest path to something we can use a depth or breadth first search. We also learnt this in terms of binary trees and the mazeSolver problem set. So, my thought process in this is that we can use a queue to keep track of all the possible ladders within 6 spaces of our current position. Over time we can one by one check these possibilities (popping them then adding new ones as we find them to the queue) until we reach the solution. If we use breadth-first search I believe that we should get the shortest move solution as the first returned one. |

It's basic logic and doesn't actually find a solution yet but its a start. |

How do I keep track of which paths I've already taken. I also tried to fix an error in my code that makes it almost always return -1 instead of 1 (couldn't figure out why this is an issue). |
