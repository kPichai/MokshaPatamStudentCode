| Sept 3 |  8:00pm - 8:30pm  | Although for this time section I didn't get any coding complete, I did work on my thought process of this problem a lot. I came up with an idea that utilizes a technique we used in CS2 last year, the idea is that to find the shortest path to something we can use a depth or breadth first search. We also learnt this in terms of binary trees and the mazeSolver problem set. So, my thought process in this is that we can use a queue to keep track of all the possible ladders within 6 spaces of our current position. Over time we can one by one check these possibilities (popping them then adding new ones as we find them to the queue) until we reach the solution. If we use breadth-first search I believe that we should get the shortest move solution as the first returned one. |

It's basic logic and doesn't actually find a solution yet but its a start. |

How do I keep track of which paths I've already taken. I also tried to fix an error in my code that makes it almost always return -1 instead of 1 (couldn't figure out why this is an issue). |

I also begin to code an array that would store all the info in the board, the current square and where you go as a result. I created a for loop to read in the data from the snakes and ladders to create this list but the code didn't work. |

Additionally, I am yet to code a way to keep count of the number of rolls but am looking for ways to work on that. Mainly in this last 30 min block I just focused on integrating the array of spaces. |
